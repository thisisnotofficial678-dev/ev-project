4. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` files for each frontend

## üîß Local Testing Before Deployment

Test your frontend applications locally with the production backend:

```bash
# Test User Frontend
cd frontend/ev-user
npm run build
npm run preview

# Test Admin Frontend
cd frontend/ev-admin/project
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üìã Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying your frontends:

1. **Update Backend CORS**: Add your deployed frontend URLs to the CORS configuration
2. **Test API Integration**: Verify that frontend can communicate with backend
3. **Test Authentication**: Ensure login/register functionality works
4. **Test Core Features**: Verify station search, booking, and payment flows
5. **Update Documentation**: Update any hardcoded URLs in your documentation

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Once deployed, your applications will automatically redeploy when you push changes to your GitHub repository.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure your backend CORS configuration includes your deployed frontend URLs
2. **API Connection Failed**: Check if your backend is running and accessible
3. **Build Failures**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify that environment variables are set correctly in your hosting platform

### Testing Your Deployment:

1. **Backend API**: Visit [https://ev-project-aymy.onrender.com/api-docs](https://ev-project-aymy.onrender.com/api-docs) for Swagger documentation
2. **Frontend Apps**: Test all major functionality after deployment
3. **Cross-Origin Requests**: Verify that frontend can make API calls to backend

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment, check:
- Your hosting platform's documentation
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed API requests
- Backend logs for server-side errors
